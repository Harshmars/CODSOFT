Guess the Number Game

The "Guess the Number" game is a simple text-based game implemented in C++. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player's objective is to guess the chosen number.

How the Game Works:

1.The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2.The player is prompted to input their guess.
3.If the player's guess is too high, they are instructed to try a smaller number.
4.If the player's guess is too low, they are prompted to try a larger number.
5.The game continues until the player correctly guesses the randomly selected number.
6.After each correct guess, the program displays the number of attempts it took the player to guess the number.

The player can choose to play the game multiple times. Each game session provides an opportunity for the player to improve their guessing skills and try to guess the number in fewer attempts.
